#stainless

A light colour scheme made with [Vivify](http://bytefluent.com/vivify/). I haven't tested it much in consoles and languages I don't use, so I wouldn't recommend it in general, but I really like the colours.

Goals of the colour scheme:

- High-contrast without being painful to look at
- Light grey background
- Clearly distinct colours
